7zp27w9oay,2024-03-14 17:06:04.664260+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,PhD (Psychology),"the fact that it is cristal clear, and the professor provide first an in depth analisis of the frequentist statistics before presenting the bayesian one.",makes the slides in pdf also!! thanks,2,2,2,2,3,4,2,4,"Premise: I am just attending the course as a visitor and I won't do the exam. I really appreciated the fact that it was mostly theoretical, as I am not used to using R and I would have found difficulties in running too many codes. I liked that the codes were embedded in the slides, but the course wasn't too much focused on it. You are a very brilliant professor, that explains the contents very clearly. I enjoyed a lot this course "
vusjdk6tcv,2024-03-14 14:14:39.766129+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,MRes (Psychology),Dom keeps things light and is very thorough,The pace in the first 5 or so weeks was quite slow and entirely covered content we'd already covered in modules last semester.,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,I love getting rick roll'd every week ^-^
7tq0b4j5fd,2024-03-14 14:13:03.568986+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,MRes (Psychology),Spiderman meme,Learn some Bayesian statistics rather than doing really basic things that we have covered in previous modules,0,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,"The TAP was very easy, with very little relevance to Bayesian statistics apart from the last two questions which we were directly told the answers to as advice for the assessment. There needs to be more planning of the content, ensuring it is relevant and considering the fact that we all have some previous experience of statistics and don't need to be taught to install packages or calculate a mean."
fds0bgqhg0,2024-03-14 14:11:40.727368+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,Postdoc,"Dom's enthuasiasm for and experience with the subject matter, and a good amount of background information presented.",Maybe even more live coding in the sessions to supplement lecturing and existing activities,2,2,2,2,4,3,3,4,"I've really enjoyed this module, and have taken some really useful information from it :)"
2v5blgpu4c,2024-03-14 14:11:08.516228+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,PhD (Psychology),"Dom's explanations are great, the recapping is really helpful each session to build up our understanding","early on, the R examples were thoroughly explained and gone over in detail, but as the module goes on (and the R coding becomes significantly more challenging and lengthy), these explanations and examples of how to do the coding have ceased. This is fine if you understand the R coding, but if you begin to fall behind then there is nothing there to help you understand or get back to full understanding. I would love to see more extensive explanations of the R coding further into the module, particularly around how to actually perform the bayesian inference and work through it all ",2,2,1,2,4,4,3,4,maybe a distinct workshop on going through all the steps in R with a real dataset to perform bayesfactor analysis and bayesian inference would help cement my understanding and apply it to my own research
olac37gcyt,2024-03-14 14:10:33.022589+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,PhD (Psychology),Charismatic teacher,"More depth on calculations, but not much",2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,Very interesting! I needed to know most of this for my viva - a further course on the maths (if possible) would be an interesting follow up
dle83fmz34,2024-03-14 14:07:48.353173+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,MRes (Psychology),"I genuinely did not know anything about Bayesian stats before and this module has been enlightening. I enjoy the pace, content and interactiveness of the class.",Nothing so far.,2,2,2,2,2,4,3,4,
rqsvsc7q8p,2024-03-14 14:05:52.071374+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,MRes (Psychology),The detailed explanations and creativity in explaining both basic and complicated concepts,"Needs more exercises, more workshop like",2,2,1,2,3,3,2,3,Would have liked if it was more intimate and we mostly masters students
01t2nf1wjs,2024-03-14 14:03:09.223821+00:00,Bayesian Statistics,Midterm,PhD (Neuroscience),how streamlined and neat the presentations were,"apart from the lectures, one/two full-on practicals would be nice",2,2,2,2,4,4,3,4,it's a very good course!
